why using CSS variables and not sass variables:
----------------------------------------------
 => because with sass variables you will need a preprocessor to compile it 
    while css variable will be handled by CSS directly 
 => we can manipulate it with JavaScript 
 => it is easier to used in the calc function 
 => CSS variables cascade and inherited 


How to declare css property:
-----------------------------
 => it need to be exist in a scoop block 
 => you can declare in any selector but then it will be used in this selector and its child 
    so we will be in the root pseudo class
 => :root is the global element 
 => how to declare property : --color-primary 
 => why start -- ; to make it different form the built in property
