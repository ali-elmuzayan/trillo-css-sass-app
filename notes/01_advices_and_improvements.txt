why using CSS variables and not sass variables:
----------------------------------------------
 => because with sass variables you will need a preprocessor to compile it 
    while css variable will be handled by CSS directly 
 => we can manipulate it with JavaScript 
 => it is easier to used in the calc function 
 => CSS variables cascade and inherited 


How to declare css property:
-----------------------------
 => it need to be exist in a scoop block 
 => you can declare in any selector but then it will be used in this selector and its child 
    so we will be in the root pseudo class
 => :root is the global element 
 => how to declare property : --color-primary 
 => why start -- ; to make it different form the built in property 
 


mask property;
---------------
 => mask-image: is  a property that specifies a mask layer image 
 => the mask layer image can be PNG image, SVG image, a CSS gradient or and SVG <mask> elemennt </mask> 
 => browser support is not great so we will need to use prefixes 


figure tag in html: 
--------------------
 => this element is perfect for review and also perfect as container for images 
 => example in our project: 
    - add figure item which will have 2 figure item each one act as a box of review 


@support property: 
-------------------
 => to add property for the project that not supported in some old browser


margin-right: auto;
=------------------
 => use it when you move item to occupy the rest of space to it
